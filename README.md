## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
This app is meant to reduce the paperwork and difficulty involved in building characters or managing dungeons and dragons campaigns. This will not remove the usefulness of maps or figures, but will help keep the math and struggle within more easily managed limits.

The app is built into different sections and tools. These include player tools and accounts.


## Players<a name="players"></a>
An account for a user is called a Player Account. A Player Account can have a profile image, a player tag, and a list of characters. There are different player roles (Player, Game Master, or Dungeon Master) with different tools or contributions available. Every account has the role of a player. These will be explained further below.

## Dungeon Masters<a name="dm"></a>
A Player Account with the role of Dungeon Master can create parties of players and start questlines. They can build maps and save them on the server, as well as create their own stories.

## Game Masters<a name="gm"></a>
A Game Master helps build the game's dynamic data. This can include feats, races, classes, monsters, or items. They can create special items, monsters, and abilities for public campaigns. They can create public campaigns.


## Characters<a name="characters"></a>
A player can have characters with their stats saved on the server. This will keep track of traits, storyline (ie. Journal entries or background), and even their equipment. The creation of a character can be done through our character building app, or it can be directly edited.
